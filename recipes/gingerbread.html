        <p>
            This recipe will show you how to create cute cookies that make it look like a gingerbread man is sleeping!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 sheet of prepared puff pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>9 chocolate squares</li>
            <li>9 gingerbread men cookies</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment.</li>
            <li>Cut a sheet of puff pastry into 9 rectangles that are twice as tall as gingerbread men cookies, and twice as wide. Space rectangles out on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Center a chocolate square on the upper third of each pastry rectangle, leaving a border of pastry uncovered at top and sides.</li>
            <li>Layer a gingerbread man cookie on top, so that the head of gingerbread cookie rests on the chocolate piece like a “pillow”.</li>
            <li>For egg wash, whisk egg with water in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Fold lower part of pastry rectangle up over the “body” of gingerbread man cookie to make a “blanket.” Crimp the sides and bottom of pastry with a fork. Brush pastry with egg wash.</li>
            <li>Bake pastries in the preheated oven until light golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with powdered sugar.</li>
        </ol>
